Can I make an announcement?

I wrote a program to help you learn English. 
It reads a file or a book in TXT aloud with her voice, such as a romatic book or that ever. 
And pauses so that you can repeat after her. 
The program needs: Windows and installed PowerShell (this is part of Windows) and a set of books or 
texts that you would like to read aloud. 

Who wish to get this program can write to me by email to me.

The voices of the program are synthetic and differ from natural ones. 
The accents are also not always correct. 
But this allows you to engage in your speech for a long time and without a living companion.

Sincerelly, Dmitrii
